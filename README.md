# Damn Vulnerable DeFi Walkthrough

This is a walkthrough for the Damn Vulnerable Defi challenges (sorry to say these don't work [anymore](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/v2-release.html)).

## How To Do The Challenges

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/damn-vulnerable-defi/tree/v1.0.0)
2. Install dependencies with npm install
3. Code your solutions in the provided *.challenge.js files (inside each challenge's folder in the test folder)
    * The file will tell you where to put you exploit
    * DON'T delete anything else in the file 
    * Any contracts used to attack add them to the folder ```./contracts/attacker-contracts```
4. Run your exploit for a challenge with npm run challenge-name. If the challenge is executed successfully, you've passed!


I was able to complete the challenges with the help of looking through [MrToph's walkthrough.](https://github.com/MrToph/damn-vulnerable-defi) whenever I got stuck.

Working on doing the [new challenges](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/v2-release.html) just released!
